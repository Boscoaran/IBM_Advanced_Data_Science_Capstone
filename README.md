This project aims to investigate the potential correlation between the plot of a film and its ratings. Leveraging the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the study involves analyzing a diverse dataset of movies to uncover patterns and trends. By employing natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to identify key elements in movie plots that may contribute to audience satisfaction or dissatisfaction, ultimately influencing the overall rating. This project serves as a conclusion of the [Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm).
